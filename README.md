My Half made Unity project.

Hello all!
This is my half made or a quater made or less than that Unity project. You all can make something out of it if you want. A few assets are already made so you don't have to worry about that. You can add a lot more to it eg: Levels, different players, boss battles etc.

<pre>
Note:This is project uses the Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
</pre>

# How to setup the project:

Via Zip file: 

1)First download the Zip file.

2)In the Unity Hub in the projects section click on add. Then go to the folder called DJ-Corona-Killer and you will see another folder called DJ Corona Killer. Select that folder and click open.

<pre>Note: We recomend cloning via command line and make sure you have git lfs intstalled in your computer.

Because we are not sure that you will be able to clone everything (shaders, meshes etc).If you don't have

git lfs installed you can do it from <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">here</a>
</pre>

Via Command Line:

1)In the command line  first type cd and then copy the path in which folder you want to save the project. Press Enter/Return.

2)In the Unity Hub in the projects section click on add. Then go to the folder called DJ-Corona-Killer and you will see another folder called DJ Corona Killer. Select that folder and click open.
